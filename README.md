# Airbnb Data Analysis Project Readme

## Overview
Welcome to the Airbnb Data Analysis project! This project aims to provide valuable insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends within the Airbnb dataset. We'll utilize MongoDB Atlas for efficient data retrieval, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop a Streamlit web application with interactive maps, and create dynamic visualizations for in-depth analysis.

## Project Objectives

### 1. MongoDB Connection
- **Objective:** Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas.
- **File:** `01_MongoDB_Connection.ipynb`

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Objective:** Clean and prepare the dataset addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.
- **File:** `02_Data_Cleaning_Preparation.ipynb`

### 3. Streamlit Web Application
- **Objective:** Develop a Streamlit web application with interactive maps for exploring Airbnb listings.
- **File:** `03_Streamlit_Web_Application.py`

### 4. Price Analysis and Visualization
- **Objective:** Conduct price analysis and visualize variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
- **File:** `04_Price_Analysis_Visualization.ipynb`

### 5. Availability Patterns Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze availability patterns, visualize occupancy rates, and explore demand fluctuations.
- **File:** `05_Availability_Patterns_Analysis.ipynb`

### 6. Location-Based Insights
- **Objective:** Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.
- **File:** `06_Location_Based_Insights.ipynb`

### 7. Interactive Visualizations
- **Objective:** Create interactive visualizations enabling users to filter and drill down into the data.
- **File:** `07_Interactive_Visualizations.ipynb`

### 8. Dashboard Creation
- **Objective:** Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI.
- **File:** `08_Tableau_PowerBI_Dashboard.ipynb`
